# KrADagrad

PyTorch implementation of Kronecker Approximation-Domination preconditioned gradient optimization

- Main code lives in in `kradagrad.py`
- We include `shampoo.py` without modification for convenience
- Methods for taking p-th roots of symmetric positive semi-definite matrices live in `matrix_root.py`
- Experimental code lives in `kradagrad_batched.py`
