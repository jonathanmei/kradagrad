**This project provides a set of examples with popular continual learning strategies and baselines. 
You can easily run experiments to reproduce results from original paper or tweak the hyperparameters to get your own results.  Sky is the limit!**

To guarantee fair implementations, we rely on the **[Avalanche](https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche)** library, developed and maintained by *[ContinualAI](https://www.continualai.org/)*.
Feel free to check it out and support the project!

## Experiments
The table below describes all the experiments currently implemented in the `experiments` folder, along with their result.  
ACC means the Average Accuracy on all experiences after training on the last experience.  
If an experiment reproduces exactly the results of a paper in terms of `Performance` (even if with different hyper-parameters), it is marked with ✅ on the `Reproduced` column. Otherwise, it is marked with ❌. 
Check the comments in each experiment for more details.  

If the `Performance` is much worse than the expected one, the `bug` tag is used in the `Reproduced` column.

## Python dependencies for experiments
Outside Python standard library, the main packages required to run the experiments are PyTorch, Avalanche and Pandas. 
* **Avalanche**: The latest version of this repo requires the latest Avalanche version (from master branch): `pip install git+https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche.git`. The CL baselines repo is tagged with the supported Avalanche version (you can browse the tags to check out all the versions). You can install the corresponding Avalanche versions with `pip install avalanche-lib==[version number]`, where `[version number]` is of the form `0.1.0`.
For some strategies (e.g., LaMAML) you may need to install Avalanche with extra packages, like `pip install avalanche-lib[extra]`. 
For more details on how to install Avalanche, please check out the complete guide [here](https://avalanche.continualai.org/getting-started/how-to-install). 
* **PyTorch**: we recommend to follow [the official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
* **Pandas**: `pip install pandas`. [Official guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html#installing-pandas).


## Run experiments with Python
Place yourself into the project root folder.

Experiments can be run with a python script by simply importing the function from the `experiments` folder and executing it.  
By default, experiments will run on GPU, when available.

The input argument to each experiment is an optional dictionary of parameters to be used in the experiments. If `None`, default
parameters (taken from original paper) will be used.

```python
from experiments.split_mnist import synaptic_intelligence_smnist  # select the experiment

 # can be None to use default parameters
custom_hyperparameters = {'si_lambda': 0.01, 'cuda': -1, 'seed': 3}

# run the experiment
result = synaptic_intelligence_smnist(custom_hyperparameters)

# dictionary of avalanche metrics
print(result)  
```

## Command line experiments
Place yourself into the project root folder.   
You should add the project root folder to your PYTHONPATH. 

For example, on Linux you can set it up globally:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/continual-learning-baselines
```
or just for the current command:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/continual-learning-baselines command to be executed
```

You can run experiments directly through console with the default parameters.  
Open the console and run the python file you want by specifying its path.

For example, to run Synaptic Intelligence on Split MNIST: 
```bash
python experiments/split_mnist/synaptic_intelligence.py
```

To execute experiment with custom parameters, please refer to the previous section.


## Run tests
Place yourself into the project root folder.

You can run all tests with
```bash
python -m unittest
```

or you can specify a test by providing the test name in the format `tests.strategy_class_name.test_benchmarkname`.

For example to run Synaptic Intelligence on Split MNIST you can run:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.SynapticIntelligence.test_smnist
```

## Contribute to the project
We are always looking for new contributors willing to help us in the challenging mission of providing robust experiments
to the community. Would you like to join us? The steps are easy!

1. Take a look at the opened issues and find yours
2. Fork this repo and write an experiment (see next section)
3. Submit a PR and receive support from the maintainers
4. Merge the PR, your contribution is now included in the project!


### Write an experiment
1. Create the appropriate script into `experiments/benchmark_folder`. If the benchmark is not present, you can add one.
2. Fill the `experiment.py` file with your code, following the style of the other experiments. The script should return the metrics used by the related test.
3. Add to `tests/target_results.csv` the expected result for your experiment. You can add a number or a list of numbers.
4. Write the unit test in `tests/strategy_folder/experiment.py`. Follow the very simple structure of existing tests.
5. Update table in `README.md`.


### Find the avalanche commit which produced a regression
1. Place yourself into the avalanche folder and make sure you are using the avalanche version from that repository 
in your python environment (it is usually enough to add `/path/to/avalanche` to your `PYTHONPATH`). 
2. Use the `gitbisect_test.sh` (provided in this repository) in combination with `git bisect` to retrieve the avalanche commit introducing the regression.  
`git bisect start HEAD v0.1.0 -- # HEAD (current version) is bad, v0.1.0 is good`  
`git bisect run /path/to/gitbisect_test.sh /path/to/continual-learning-baselines optional_test_name`  
`git bisect reset`
3. The `gitbisect_test.sh` script requires a mandatory parameter pointing to the `continual-learning-baselines`
directory and an optional parameter specifying the path to a particular unittest (e.g., `tests.EWC.test_pmnist`).
If the second parameter is not given, all the unit tests will be run.
4. The terminal output will tell you which commit introduced the bug
5. You can change the `HEAD` and `v0.1.0` ref to any avalanche commit.
